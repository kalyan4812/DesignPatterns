/*
A Simple Factory pattern returns an instance of one of several possible (sub) classes
depending on the data provided to it. Usually all classes that it returns have a common parent
class and common methods, but each performs a task differently and is optimized for different
kinds of data.
 */

/*
In programmerâ€™s language, you can use factory pattern where you have to create an
object of any one of sub-classes depending on the data provided.
